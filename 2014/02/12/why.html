          <h2>Why?</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Feb 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>How often do you ask yourself: &quot;Is it time for the new project?&quot;. Does the thought of it excites you? Have you caught yourself thinking about thrilling prototypes, projects and experiments you could be building and conviniently
came up with a number of excuses why you won&#39;t do it just &quot;right now&quot;. I have. Too many times. I have caught myself missing that &quot;project excitement&quot; outside of work and reading fantasy books instead, watching TV shows with my wife, messing around the house.</p>

<p>While I definitely continue reading fantasy books I do certainly miss the excitement of building games and game aspect prototypes. It is like a test to me, testing my ability to learn certain different elements, ability to connect them.</p>

<p>One of my biggest problems is the fact that once excitement ends and grind starts I often abandon project and move to the next thrilling challenge. While I cannot honestly claim to myself that I will be able to finish this project, having a pressure of documenting ongoing work and thought processes should be enough to pass grinding phrases.</p>

<p>Why strategy? There are too many aspects and components I haven&#39;t played with in strategies. I haven&#39;t done it before, dont really know where to start or what &quot;proper&quot; development entails. This is going to be fun.</p>
