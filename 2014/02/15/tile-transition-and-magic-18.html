<h2>Tile Transition & Magic 18</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Feb 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Unless you are using only 1 type of terrain chances are you will need to make
sprite transitions. Here is where magic 18 is coming from. You need 18 tiles
to provide any two tile transitions - it doesn&#39;t matter what transitions are or where they are at. Two of them are main tiles. Rest 16 are transitions. Lets say we want to connect two common elements - water and ground. Here are 18 tiles that we will need (water is blue, ground is green).</p>

<p>There are many variances of this system where you can create unequal balance of transitions (to cover one type of terrain as primary you will need 16 sprites, to cover both you will need 30). Obviously you can add some of your creative skill and talent to this to vary some edges and make it a bit prettier, smoother and even randomize it.</p>
