<h2>Few Advices For Myself</h2>
<p class="meta">13 Feb 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>So now I have decided to do a project. Along this exciting and sometimes cumbersome road very often I discover traps of occasional grind, swamps of  unrelated technology problems and quicksand of evergrowing complexity. There are few advices (albeit common sense, however often neglected), importance of which I can&#39;t stress enough that I foresee will be helping me in this journey.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Keep things simple</strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, I do want to build the game of my dream and my mind is spawning millions of features and minor details that make every project so exciting. However, not focusing on keeping project simple and reachable often means not getting anything done. I am not talking about full blown SMART criteria, but do keep yourself in check, dont be too ambitios, dont let yourself get distracted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short feedback loop</strong>.</p>

<p>Constantly, I have to remind myself that I am not building this project to make a living as or a profession. I am doing it on my spare time. This means keeping interest is crucial and I have to support that by designing work to be done in small, visible units.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Figure out your development balance</strong>.</p>

<p>Oh, this ever elusive balance between &quot;doing it right&quot; and &quot;getting it done&quot; (generalization). Funny thing is that a lot dev architects, senior/lead engineers I talk to claim to have obtained that perfect balance (a few would more carefully use &#39;somewhat healty balance&#39; phrase). Good for you, now tell me more about that dream of yours. I guess, it is still better than joining any of the extreme camps like &quot;always be shipping&quot;. I know
my balance will not be perfect for this project, I know that plank will shift from feature to feature and its ok. I will do what works, I will try to perfect few important parts, I will do a lot in between and most importantly I will have fun while doing it.</p></li>
