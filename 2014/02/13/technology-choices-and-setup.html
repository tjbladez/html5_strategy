<h2>Tech Choices & Setup</h2>
<p class="meta">13 Feb 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Game genre check. Available time check. Now what? Well, its time to make few technology choices.</p>

<p>I have decided to stick with html5/javascript for the game because it is very easy to develop, host and play. It will have its own flaws but I am ready to deal with it.</p>

<p>Next choice is what will we use to tweening, rendering, controls and most things that make a game. You roll it completely on your own, use some sort of what is now called a javascript game engine (albeit missing lots of properties of game engines) or just use different collection of libraries to help with each element separately.  Check out <a href="http://html5gameengine.com/">pretty good js engine/libraries comparison</a>. For the purpose of this project I will be rolling with the <a href="http://impactjs.com/">impact.js</a> since I already own a license for it, played with it so pretty aware of its benefits &amp; limitations and even contributed some code to it.
I&#39;d rather minimize the fight with the game engine and focus on the game itself. There is still plenty of yak shaving.</p>

<p>Alright, now with the development process I am going with that I&#39;ve done a number of times and am confortable with. Repository is on the github <a href="http://github.com/tjbladez/html5_strategy">http://github.com/tjbladez/html5_strategy</a>,
project itself right now is hosted for free on heroku <a href="http://html5-strategy.herokuapp.com">http://html5-strategy.herokuapp.com</a>. Naming it is something I dont care at this point in time and can always do it later. Although you can play the game by just opening <code>index.html</code> in your browser at this point, I have also provided node based express server for the game. Code itself I will write in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">coffeescript</a>.</p>

<p>Setup was fairly straight forward. Had a minor problem with heroku static file serving. Deployments are ready both for <code>gh-pages</code> and game itself. Lets get something rendering.</p>
